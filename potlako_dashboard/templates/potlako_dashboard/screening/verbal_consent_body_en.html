 Good [morning/afternoon/evening], my name is [state your name]. I am part of the Potlako+ 
 study at the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute. I believe you received some information from 
 your health provider about it during your recent visit.  Do you have time a few minutes 
 to discuss the study? <br>
 
 <ul>
   <li>If yes, continue below.. </li>
   <li>If no, but the potential subject is interested in participating, determine a 
       better time to call back to discuss the study.  </li>
   <li>If no and asks not be contacted again, thank them for their time. </li>
 </ul>
 
 We are inviting you to take part in a research study because your health provider 
 thought that you could have cancer and needed further care. We are trying to understand 
 if providing education and support to patients can allow cancer to be diagnosed and treated earlier.  <br> <br>

 Participation in the study involves agreeing to be provided with the education and support messages 
 through telephone calls as described in this form. <br> <br>
			
 Whether or not you take part is up to you. You can choose not to take part. You can agree to take 
 part and later change your mind. Your decision will not be held against you. You may discuss your 
 decision with your family, your friends and/or your health provider. You can ask all the questions 
 you want before you decide. <br> <br>
			
 <strong> Any questions at this time? [pause] </strong> <br> <br>
 
 Most patients will be part of the study for about one year.  The study involves 20 communities and their 
 clinics in Botswana.  In all communities, the study trained health providers about when to consider cancer 
 and how to make a diagnosis. We will call patients with possible cancer to provide counselling and ask about 
 their symptoms. We will call again at 6 and 12 months later ask questions about medical care you received.  <br> <br>
 
 In half of communities, we will provide additional support to patients through a program we call Potlako. 
 Communities are picked at random, like the flip of a coin, to receive the Potlako program.  If your 
 community has been picked for Potlako, we will assist you and your health provider with determining the 
 best way to know if you have cancer, scheduling health visits, providing counselling and education, and 
 helping find solutions to challenges you face. We will call you after each of your health visits, when your 
 test results are available, and when we think that a call could help speed your care. If your community was 
 not picked for Potlako you will receive the support calls now and at 6 and 12 months.<br> <br>
 
 <strong> Any questions at this time? [pause]</strong> <br> <br>
				
 We do not think that the study could be bad for most patients. However, sometimes our calls will come at 
 inconvenient times or our questions could make you uncomfortable. You can tell us to call you at different 
 time and can decline to answer any question.  We will protect your private information carefully.   <br> <br>

 We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, we 
 think that the counselling and support will help most patients understand their illness and learn 
 faster what they can do about it.  <br> <br>
			
 <strong> Any questions at this time? [pause]</strong> <br> <br>
			
 If we are unable to reach you, we will try phone numbers of friends and family that you provide. If we still 
 cannot reach you, we will talk with community leaders to help find you. We will keep your health information 
 private and only ask about ways to find you.  <br> <br>

 Participation in research is completely voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate. 
 Instead of being in this research study, you can continue to receive typical care for your symptoms without 
 our regular calls and support of your health providers. About 1500 people will take part in this research. <br> <br>

 You will receive 50 pula for study phone calls at the start of the study, 6 months later, and after 12 
 months for a total of 150 pula. Money will be given as airtime. You will not be compensated for other 
 calls like those to schedule appointments or provide you with information.  <br> <br>
